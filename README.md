# Flask-Website

I created this website to promote and sell a Sofware application (Code not available).

I used Flask for the backend and html and css (bootstrap) for the frontend.

## Objectve

This website's objective is to sell and validate product keys. To be able to do this it needs to be able to:

### - Read the blockchain's transaction history to check if the payment was made:

This was acomplished through the use of an api that is able to look into the blockchain History.

###  - Store the Users information and the data necesary to keep a well organized database

I used MySQL to create and manage the database.

###  - An API so that the application can verify if the key that's being introduces is Valid
 
This makes flask a great framework to develop this Website because it makes creating a functioning APY very easy and convenient.

All this functionalitys have been implemented and work correctly. If there are any doubts, you an allways contact me :3
