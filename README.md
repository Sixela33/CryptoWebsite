# Flask-Website
This was my first attempt at making a website

I created this website to promote and sell a Sofware application.

I used Flask for the backend and html and css (bootstrap) for the frontend.



## Technologies

 - Python
 - Flask
 - SQL
 - HTML
 - Bootstrap
 
## Objectve

This website's objective is to sell and validate product keys. To be able to do this it needs to be able to:

### - Read the blockchain's transaction history to check if the payment was made:

This was acomplished through the use of an api that is able to look into the blockchain History.

###  - Store the Users information and the data necesary to keep a well organized database

I used MySQL to create and manage the database.

###  - An API so that the application can verify if the key that's being introduces is Valid
 
This makes flask a great framework to develop this Website because it makes creating a functioning APY very easy and convenient.

## Setup

  ``` $ pip install -r requirements.txt ```
 
 Install all requirements in the "Requirements.txt" File and you are ready to go!
 run "run.py" To start the server
